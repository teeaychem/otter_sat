/*!
Databases for holding information relevant to a solve.

  - [The clause database](crate::db::clause)
    + A collection of clauses, each indexed by a clause key. \
      From an external perspective there are two important kinds of clause:
      * Original clauses \
        Original clauses are added to the context from some external source (e.g. directly or through some DIMACS file). \
        The collection of original clauses together with the collection of original literals are the CNF formula ùêÖ whose satisfiability may be determined.
      * Added clauses \
        Clauses added to the context by some procedure (e.g. via resolution).
        Every added clause is a consequence of the collection of original clauses.

  - [The assignment database](crate::db::atom)
    + Details of assignments made, such as the current valuation and the source of each assignment.
