/*!
Assumptions

# Overview

The [solve_given](GenericContext::solve_given) method performs a solve given some collection of literals to assume. \

Internally, assumptions are handled at the initial stages of the method, and in particular through the [assert_assumptions](GenericContext::assert_assumptions) method.

The distinction between adding and asserting assumptions allows for distinct ways of making assumptions (see below).

# Ways of making assumptions

Two ways of making assumptions are supported: Stacked and flat.

# Stacked
A new decision level for each assumption, and immediately applies BCP to an assumption when the level is created.

# Flat
A single decision level for all assumptions and delay BCP until the valuation has been updated with all valuations.

    /**
    Identifies the assumptions used to derive `conflict`.

    Derived from reading MiniSATs `analyzeFinal`.

    The conflict, if it exists, is due to some chain of BCP.
    And, so long as an assumption was used in some part of the chain, it was used to derive the conflict.

    Each part of the chain can be examined by walking through each level, of which at least one must exist if an assumption has been made.
    And, so long as the walk is made backwards a literal is used before it is assumed or derived.
    So, by keeping track of use through a reverse walk, use of an assumption is noted before the assumption is made.
    And, likewise for use of any derived literal, allowing a note to be made on the literals used to derive that (derived) literal.
