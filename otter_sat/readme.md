otter_sat is a library for determining the satisfiability of boolean formulas written in conjunctive normal form, using a variety of techniques from the literature on conflict-driven clause-learning solving, and with support for incremental solves.

otter_sat is developed to help researchers, developers, or anyone curious, to investigate satisfiability solvers, whether as a novice or through implementing novel ideas.

Some guiding principles of the library are:
- Modularity.
- Documentation, of both implementation and theory.
- Verification (of core parts of the library through the production of FRAT proofs and external proof checkers).
- Simple efficiency.

- For documentation, see [https://docs.rs/otter_sat]
- For an associated cli application and tools to verify (parts of) the library see [https://github.com/teeaychem/otter_sat]
