A simple conflict driven SAT solver, written in Rust for skill and research.

At present, features include:

- Clause learning thorugh analysis of implication graphs
- A VSIDS choice selection heuristic.
- Two-watch lazy inspection.
- Watch lists.
- An unsatisfiable core of the original formula, if the formua is UNSAT.
- Some documentation.
- A very long list of todos!

Docmentation and tests are moslty added as the solver develops and parts solidify.
For the moment, things are fairly green.
