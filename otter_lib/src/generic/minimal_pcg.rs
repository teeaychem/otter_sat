//! A simple pseudorandom number generator.
//!
//! Specifically, a translation of the *really* minimal C PCG32 implementation from <https://www.pcg-random.org/> implemented to satisfy the [Random](std::random) trait.[^note]
//!
//! PCG(32) was chosen as the default source of (pseudo)random numbers as it is simple, fast, and has some nice supporting documentation.
//!
//! Each [context](crate::context) stores a source of rng as a [counter](crate::context::Counters).
//! The counter structure is paramaterised to anything which satisfies the [Random](std::random) trait.
//! Though to keep the rest of the library straightforward the rng is fixed in the [context](crate::context) as [MinimalPCG32].
//! Still, revising or paramaterising the context is all that's needed for a different source of rng.
//!
//! [^note]: At the time of writing, the C implementation is at the top of the [download page](https://www.pcg-random.org/download.html).
