/*
A struct abstracting over decision levels.
Internally this makes use of a pair of private structs.
Though, this should probably be revised at some pointâ€¦

- KnowledgeLevel
  Aka. decision level zero
  This contains assumptions or proven literals

- DecisionLevel
  A choice and the consequences of that choice

Specifically, each structs can be replaced by a simple vec.
And, for decision levels a stack of pointers to where the level began would work.
The choice/consequence distinction requires some attention, though.

For now, this works ok.
