<h1>Randomly generated instances - constant density model</h1>
<br>



Random instances of the constant density model are generated in the
following way: For an instance with n variables and k clauses, clauses
are generated by including a variable with a fixed probability p, and
then negating the variable with probability 0.5. Because formulas
generated in this way may contain empty clauses or unit
clauses. Hence, empty clauses and unit clauses are rejected in the
generation process. The resulting problem distribution is called
<i>Random P-SAT</i> in [SML96]. <br><br> It should be noted here that
empirical as well as theoretical results indicate that instances
generated by this model tend to be much easier than Uniform
Random-3-SAT instances and therefore the latter appear to be much
better suited for a set of hard benchmark instances. We refer to
[SML96] and [ML96] for a more detailed discussion.


<h4>Benchmark instances</h4>


There is a total of 50 benchmark instances of this class of different
sizes in this class; there are 40 instances with 100 variables and 800
clauses, the other 10 instances have 100 variables and 900 clauses.
<br><br> 

Of the 50 instances 16 instances are satisfiable, all others are
unsatisfiable. The satisfiable instances are the following:<br><br> <i>
jnh201.cnf, jnh204.cnf, jnh205.cnf, jnh207.cnf, jnh209.cnf,
jnh210.cnf, jnh212.cnf, jnh213.cnf, jnh217.cnf, jnh218.cnf,
jnh220.cnf, jnh301.cnf, jnh212.cnf</i><br><br>
All other instances are unsatisfiable.<br>
