<h1>SAT-encoded Towers of Hanoi Problems</h1>

The Towers of Hanoi is the following well known problem:<br><br>

One is given three pins and a stack of <i>n</i> discs of decreasing
diameter on one of the pins. The problem then is to transfer these
<i>n</i> discs to one of the other pins according to the following rules:

<UL>
<LI>(1) A move places a disc on another pin</LI>
<LI>(2) Only one disc at a time can be moved</LI>
<LI>(3) A disc may not be placed on top of a smaller disc</LI>
</UL>

The problem then involves finding a sequence of moves which, when
applied to the initial configuration, lead to the goal situation.

<h4>Benchmark instances</h4>

There are two SAT-encoded instances available from the original DIMACS
challenge set; both instances had been contributed by Bart Selman and
Henry Kautz. The instances involve 4 and 5 discs, respectively. The
instances are described in Table 1; they belong to some of the hardest
instances of our benchmark suit.<br><br>
