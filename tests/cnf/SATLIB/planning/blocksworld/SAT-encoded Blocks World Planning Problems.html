<h1>SAT-encoded Blocks World Planning Problems</h1>

The Blocks World is a very well-known problem domain in AI research. 
The general scenario in Blocks World Planning comprises 
a number of blocks and a table. The blocks can be piled onto 
each other, where the downmost block of a pile is always on the table.
For the benchmark problems, taken from [KS96],
there is only one operator which moves the top block of a 
pile to the top of another pile or onto the table.
Given an initial and a goal configuration of blocks, the problem
is to find a sequence of operators which, when applied to 
the initial configuration, leads to the goal situation.
Such a sequence is called a (linear) plan.
Blocks can only be moved when they are clear, i.e., no other block is piled
on top of them, and they can be only moved on top of blocks which are clear
or onto the table. If these conditions are satisfied, the move operator 
always succeeds.
There is an optimisation and 
a decision variant of the Blocks World Planning problem:
In the optimisation variant, the goal is to find a shortest plan, 
whereas in the decision variant, the question is to decide whether 
a plan of a given length exists. 
The two variants are tightly related, as shortest plans can 
be found by solving a series of decision problems.
SAT-based approaches to Blocks World Planning typically focus on 
the decision variant.

<h4>SAT encoding</h4>

A linear encoding strategy was used for translating Blocks World
instances into CNF formulae.
The encoding is based on the following predicates:

<UL>
<LI> <i>clear(x,t)</i> - block <i>x</i> is clear at time <i>t</i>
<LI> <i>on(x,y,t)</i> - block <i>x</i> is directly on top of <i>y</i> at time <i>t</i>
<LI> <i>move(x,y,z,t)</i> - block <i>x</i> is moved from block <i>y</i>
	on block <i>z</i> at time <i>t</i>
</UL>
	
<p>
<i>clear</i> and <i>on</i> are state predicates, while <i>move</i> is an
action predicate. The axioms which specify the problem can be grouped into
4 categories:

<p>
<UL>
<LI> actions imply their preconditions and effects,
<LI> exactly one action can be executed at each time <i>t</i>,
<LI> classical frame conditions which
	state that state predicates do not change between
	<i>t</i> and <i>t+1</i> if they are not directly affected by 
	the action at time <i>t</i>,
<LI> in <i>move(x,y,z,t)</i>, <i>x</i>,<i>y</i>, and <i>z</i> are distinct.
</UL>

<p>
The last group of actions is redundant, but
has been found to be useful for speeding up local search.
For a given blocks world planning instance, instantiating 
the predicates listed above gives the propositional variables
over which the axioms can then be formulated as CNF clauses.

<p>
The SAT encoding used for generating the benchmark problems
relies critically on two important techniques for reducing the 
size of the CNF formulae: operator splitting [KMS96] and 
simple propositional reductions (unit propagation and subsumption).
Operator splitting replaces a predicate which take three or
more arguments by a number of binary predicates. This
reduces the number of propositional variables
for the given problem from <i>O(kn^3)</i> to <i>O(kn^2)</i> where <i>n</i> is
the number of blocks and <i>k</i> the number of plan steps.
Unit propagation and subsumptions, two well-known
propositional reduction strategies, are used to simplify the formulae
before applying stochastic local search. These reducations can be 
computed in polynomial time and eliminate a number of propositional 
variables thus efficiently reducing the search space.
Intuitively, these by applying these strategies the 
initial and goal states are propagated into the planning structure.
Details on the SAT encoding used to generate the
benchmark problems can be found in [KS96,KMS96].

<h4>The benchmark instances</h4>

<p>
Our benchmark set contains 7 blocks world planning instances
taken from Henry Kautz' and Bart Selman's SATPLAN distribution.
These instances are described in Table 1; 
despite the reductions mentioned above, they are still
very large when compared to other instances of our benchmark suit.
bw_large.c and bw_large.d belong to the hardest problems which can 
be solved by state-of-the-art SAT algorithms in reasonable time.
