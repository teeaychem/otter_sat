<h1>SAT-encoded Logistics Planning Problems</h1>

In the logistics planning domain, packages have to be moved
between different locations in different cities. 
Within cities, packages are carried by
trucks while between cities they are flown in planes. Both, trucks and
airplanes are of limited capacity. 
The problem involves 3 operators <i>(load, unload, move)</i>
and two state predicates <i>(in,at)</i>.
The initial and goal state specify locations for 
all packages, trucks, and planes;
the plans allow multiple actions to be executed simultaneously,
as long as no conflicts arise from their preconditions and effects.
Like in the Blocks World Plannig problem,
there is an optimisation and a decition variant of 
the Logistics Planning problem:
In the optimisation variant, the goal is to find a shortest plan, 
whereas in the decision variant, the question is to decide whether 
a plan of a given length exists. 
Again, the two variants are tightly related, as shortest plans can 
be found by solving a series of decision problems.
SAT-based approaches to Logistics Planning typically focus on 
the decision variant.

<h4>SAT encoding of Logistics Planning instances</h4>

A state-based encoding strategy was used for translating
Logistics instances into CNF formulae.
In this encoding, only the state predicates are explicitely
represented by propositional variables, whereas 
the operators are only implicitly represented by
constraints on transitions of the state predicates.

<p>
The SAT encoding used for generating the benchmark problems
relies critically on two important techniques for reducing the 
size of the CNF formulae: operator splitting [KMS96] and 
simple propositional reductions (unit propagation and subsumption).
Operator splitting replaces a predicate which take three or
more arguments by a number of binary predicates. This
reduces the number of propositional variables
for the given problem from <i>O(kn^3)</i> to <i>O(kn^2)</i> where <i>n</i> is
the number of blocks and <i>k</i> the number of plan steps.
Unit propagation and subsumptions, two well-known
propositional reduction strategies, are used to simplify the formulae
before applying stochastic local search. These reducations can be 
computed in polynomial time and eliminate a number of propositional 
variables thus efficiently reducing the search space.
Intuitively, these by applying these strategies the 
initial and goal states are propagated into the planning structure.
Details on the SAT encoding used to generate the
benchmark problems can be found in [KS96,KMS96].


<h4>The benchmark instances</h4>

<p>
Our benchmark set contains 7 blocks world planning instances
taken from Henry Kautz' and Bart Selman's SATPLAN distribution.
These instances are described in Table 1; 
despite their size they seem to be easier
than the Blocks World Planning instances for local search methods.
