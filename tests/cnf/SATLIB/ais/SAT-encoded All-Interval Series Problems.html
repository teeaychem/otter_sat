<h1>SAT-encoded All-Interval Series Problems</h1>

The All-Interval Series (AIS) problem is an arithmetic problem 
first used in [Hoos98] in the context of evaluating SLS algorithms
and now contained in 
<A HREF="http://csplib.cs.strath.ac.uk/prob/prob007/">CSPLIB (prob007)</A>.
It is inspired by a well-known problem occurring in serial musical
composition, which, in its original form,
can be stated in the following way:

Given the twelve standard pitch-classes (c,c#,d, ...),
represented by numbers <i>0,1,...,11</i>, find a series in which each
pitch-class occurs exactly once and in which the musical 
intervals between neighbouring notes cover the full set of
intervals from the minor second (1 semitone) to the
major seventh (11 semitones), i.e., for each of these intervals,
there is a pair of neigbhouring pitch-classes in the series, 
between which this interval appears.

These musical all-interval series have a certain prominence
in serial composition; they can be traced back
to Alban Berg and have been extensively studied and used
by Ernst Krenek, e.g., in his orchestral piece op.170,
``Quaestio temporis'' (A Question of Time).

The problem of finding such series can be easily
formulated as an instance of a more general arithmetic problem in
<i>Z_n</i>, the set of integer residues modulo <i>n</i>:

For given positive integer <i>n</i>, find a vector 
<i>s = (s_1, ..., s_n)</i>, such that

<OL>
<LI> <i>s</i> is a permutation of <i>Z_n = {0,1,...,n-1}</i>; and
<LI>  the interval vector 
	<i>v = (|s_2-s_1|, |s_3-s_2|, ... |s_n-s_{n-1}|)</i> 
	is a permutation of <i>Z_n-{0} = {1,2,...,n-1}</i>.
</ol>

A vector <i>v</i> satisfying these conditions is called
an <i>all-interval series of size n</i>;
the problem of finding such a series is called the
<i>All-Interval Series Problem of size n</i>.


<h4>SAT encoding</h4>

The all-interval series problem can be represented as a 
Constraint Satisfaction Problem in a rather straightforward way.
Each element of <i>s</i> and <i>v</i> is represented as a variable; 
the domains of these variables are <i>Z_n</i> and <i>Z_n-{0}</i>,
respectively; and the contraint relations encode the
conditions 1. and 2. from the definition given above.
From this CSP formulation, instances of the all-interval series 
problem can be easily transformed
into a SAT instance by using essentially the same encoding
as for the Graph Colouring Problem, where each assignment
of a value to a single CSP variable is represented by a 
propositional variable; each of the three sets of 
constraints from the definition above is represented 
by a set of clauses; and two additional sets of clauses 
ensure that valid SAT assignments 
assign exactly one value to each CSP variable.


<h4>Hardness</h4>

There is a constructive solution to the  All-Interval Series problem
which does not require any search, therefore the pure problem is 
inherently easy.
The SAT encoded problems, considering their size, very hard
for local search methods like GSAT or Walksat [Hoos98]
but rather easy for systematic algorithms, such as satz.

<a href="http://csplib.cs.strath.ac.uk/prob/prob007/helmut.pdf">
Simonis and Beldiceanu</a> showed that using the CHIP CSP solver
on a CSP formulation using global constraints the canonical
solution can be found without search
while finding all solutions is difficult even with the efficient 
cycle constraint.

In musical composition, solutions different from the
canonical solution, which has a very regular
interval structure, might be more interesting.
Furthermore, it might be interesting to slightly modify the problem
by adding additional constraints on the structure of the
series.

The all-interval series problem presents several potential 
challenge for SAT algorithms:

<UL>
<LI>for local search algorithms, to find the canonical
  as efficiently as when using systematic search;
<LI>for stochastic (systematic or local) search algorithms
  to sample the full solution space in a reasonably unbiased way;
<LI>for complete algorithms, to find all solutions (an apparently hard problem,
  although the number of solutions is relatively small).
</UL>


<h4>The benchmark instances</h4>

<p>
The benchmark set provided here contains
the four (satisfiable) SAT instances for n=6,8,10,12.
The larger problem instances
have found to be extremely hard to solve for state-of-the-art SLS-based SAT 
algorithms [Hoos98], all instances are fairly easy for systematic search.
