Large SAT-encoded Graph Colouring Problems</H1>
The Graph Colouring problem (GCP) is a well-known combinatorial problem
from graph theory: Given a graph <I>G=(V,E)</I>, where <I>V={v_1,v_2,...,v_n}</I>
is the set of vertices and <I>E</I> the set of edges connecting the vertices,
find a colouring <I>C: V -> <B>N</B></I>, such that connected vertices
always have different colours. There are two variants of this problem:
In the optimisation variant, the goal is to find a colouring with a minimal
number of colours, whereas in the decision variant, the question is to
decide whether for a particular number of colours, a couloring of the given
graph exists. The two variants are tightly related, as optimal colourings
can be found by solving a series of decision problems, using, for instance,
binary search to determine the minimal number of colours. In the context
of SAT-encoded Graph Colouring problems, we focus on the decision variant.
<H4>
SAT encoding</H4>
Following earlier approaches in literature, we use a straightforward strategy
for encoding GCP instances into SAT: Each assignment of a colour to a single
vertex is represented by a propositional variable; each colouring constraint
(edge of the graph) is represented by a set of clauses ensuring that the
corresponding vertices have different colours, and two additional sets
of clauses ensure that valid SAT assignments assign exactly one colour
to each vertex.
<H4>
Large DIMACS GCP instances</H4> The large graph colouring instances
included in the DIMACS benchmark test-set&nbsp; (see Table 1) stem
originally from a study of algorithms for the optimisation variant of
the graph colouring problem which has focused on Simulated Annealing
[JAMS89]. The instances stem from randomly generated graphs in which
an edges between two given vertices is included with a fixed
probability <i>p</i>. All the instances are satisfiable.<br>
Interestingly, the instances <I>g125.18.cnf</i> and <I>g125.17.cnf</i>
are based on the same graph, in the first instance 18-colouring are
allowed and in the latter only 17 colours are allowed. In fact, when
trying to solve these two instances with Walksat, instance
<I>g125.18.cnf</i> is easily solved with reasonable parameter
settigns, while instance <I>g125.17.cnf</i> is much harder.<br><br>
